                    Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, born 15 September 1977, is a Nigerian writer and activist. Regarded as a central figure in postcolonial feminist literature, she is the author of the novels Purple Hibiscus (2003), Half of a Yellow Sun (2006), and Americanah (2013). Her other works include the book of essays *We Should All Be Feminists* (2014); *Dear Ijeawele, or A Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions* (2017); a memoir, *Notes on Grief* (2021); and a children's book, *Mama's Sleeping Scarf* (2023).
                    <br><br>
                    Adichie was born and raised in Enugu. After her secondary education, she studied medicine and pharmacology for a year and a half at the University of Nigeria. At 19, she left Nigeria for the United States to study at Drexel University and would later study at three universities: Eastern Connecticut State University, Johns Hopkins University, and Yale University.
                    <br><br>
                    Citing Chinua Achebe and Buchi Emecheta as inspiration, Adichie's style juxtaposes Western and African influences, with particular influence from the Igbo culture. Most of her works, including her writing and speeches, explore the themes of religion, immigration, gender, and culture. She also uses fashion as a medium to break down stereotypes and was recognized with a Shorty Award in 2018 for her "Wear Nigerian Campaign". Adichie has received numerous honors, including a MacArthur Fellowship in 2008 and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017.
